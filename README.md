# An alternative way to loop is the for loop. The syntax is as shown in the code editor. This example means “for each number i in the range 0 - 9, print i“.

print "Counting..."

for i in range(20):
  print i
  
  # Will print from 1-19

  # Hobbies 
hobbies = []

# Add your code below!

for num in range(3):
  hobby =  raw_input("Tell me one of your favorite hobbies: ")
  hobbies.append(hobby)

print hobbies

#  For and Strings:
# Using a for loop, you can print out each individual character in a string.

# The example in the editor is almost plain English: “for each character c in thing, print c“.


thing = "spam!"

for c in thing:
  print c

word = "eggs!"

# Your code here!
for i in word:
  print i
