# Loop
Using loops 

#While:
count = 0

if count < 5:
  print "Hello, I am an if statement and count is", count
#will meet condition if it is true


while count < 5:
  print "Hello, I am a while and count is", count
  count += 1
  #will continue to loop until it reaches condition. 


#Excercise, make count to 9, can either be set to <10 or <=9


while count <= 9:
  print "Hello, I am a while and count is", count
  count += 1
  #will print "" statement 9 times with the count included.
  #-------------#
  
#Condition:


loop_condition = True

while loop_condition:
  print "I am a loop"
  loop_condition = False

#The loop_condition is set to true, when it is it will it print statement, it is not the second time, so process terminates.
