# Loop
Using a for loop, you can print out each individual character in a string.

The example in the editor is almost plain English: “for each character c in thing, print c“.


thing = "spam!"

for c in thing:
  print c

  
  print "&" 

word = "eggs!"

# Your code here!
for i in word:
  print i


phrase = "A bird in the hand..."

# Add your for loop

for char in phrase:
  if char == "A" or char == "a":
      print "X", 

  else:
    print char,
